---Project(1).Playwright Basics--

Purpose: A basic demo to a beginner to understand the followings:

How to Set up the project by installing  dependencies like Node and NPM packages?
-How to install Playwright successfully ?
-How to run successfully those out of the box tests provided by Playwright?
-Write a basic test to launch a browser
-Navigate to a webpage(Example: BBC)
-It will check if a text exist or not (Example: BBC)



-How to Set up the project by installing all the dependencies ?

      -Install Nodejs LTS version from
      https://nodejs.org/en/download

            -Execute the .exe and installing
            -Open the command prompt as an admin
            -Issue command:    node -v and press ENTER
            -Issue command:    npm -v and press ENTER
            -If you see the version numbers appearing for each of the above commands.(i.e,if you have successfully installed Node!)
            (if not re-start the machine and re check!)            
       
            -Create a folder annd install the latest NPM globally by issuing following commands.
                 npm install -g npm        
                
             Why NPM ?  It help us to install many software libraries and manage dependencies.
            -If successful you should be able to issue npm -v  command from directory and see the latest version number that you have just installed!
            -Clone the repo from https://github.com/KC0122/playwright-core-project1.git ,open command prompt and CD into the same folder.


 -How to install Playwright successfully ?
      -All set to Install Playwright!Cloned repo looks like this on my machine! D:\Myprojects\playwright-core-project1
      -CD into this same folder in the Command prompt
      -Double check by re issuing node -v & npm -v one after another, to see if they are still working or not.
      (Note in some machines the VSCode terminal window might give you an error if you issue the npm -v command.But in a command prompt as an admin, you should be able to see the version)
      
      -If all good, now issue the below command to install the latest Playwright version
         npm init playwright@latest
      -
       During the installation, it will ask few questions and after entering "Y" for the first question,
         keep pressing 'Enter' to go ahead with the defaults values.
         Once done, you should see below message on the command prompt
         
         Visit https://playwright.dev/docs/intro for more information. âœ¨
        
-Issue   npx playwright test  command, and you will see 2 tests are passing!
           
           Happy hacking! ðŸŽ­

-To open the report issue the below command
   npx playwright show-report!

How to integrate Playwright Tests into TestRail?
****************************************************************

Pree-requisites

-You should have Node installed in the machine
-You have Npm in the machine
-You should have the latest Python version installed in the machine

Then issue below commands:

-To install TestRail CLI
     npm install with the --global

-You now need to set the PATH variable
     -Search for Enviornmental variables
     -Click on Enviornment variable
     - In the top panel (User variable for user section), click on Path
     -Click Edit

            - parse_robot: Robot Framework XML Files
            - parse_openapi: OpenAPI YML Files
            - add_run: Create a new test run

-Also login into your Testrail acount and  in the administration area in TestRail under Administration > Site Settings > API.'
       API should be enabled
-Open Playwright.config
   find the reporter section.Copy and paste the below

    ['junit', { outputFile: 'Junit-test-results.xml', embedAnnotationsAsProperties: true,}]
  ],


-You need to embed few infor which will help to transfer these test details to TestRail


      for ex: Your tests should have these infor:


      test('Upload via filechooser method', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {

      .....
      ....
      ..   
      testInfo.annotations.push({ type: 'testrail_attachment', description: "This is a test automation trial with TestRail" });
      });


--First you need to run the tests as per usual
    npx playwright test

-Login into TestRail and make sure you have admin roles set up.(In the settings, go add all roles and save)

-After that in order to push the test results to TestRail you need to issue the below:
(make sure you select paste as "one line")

trcli -y -h https://qatestingiwc1234.testrail.io/ 
-u sacakameel@googlemail.com 
-p Balapitiya$01 
--project "TestRail_Integration_Trial" 
parse_junit 
--title "Testrun-23-07-2025"
-f "./Results.xml"
